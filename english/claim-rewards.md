# ðŸ’¸ Claim Rewards

The winner needs to send a claiming message to the pool process to withdraw the rewards to their wallet or personal process. After the message is sent, the pool will transfer the entire rewards balance in a single transaction. The rewards balance must be >= 0.01 ALT. A 10% income tax will be deducted from the claimed amount. If your balance is 0.01 ALT, the received amount after deduction is 0.009 ALT.

```lua
Send({Target=POOL,Action="Claim"})
```

After sending the claiming message, if the rewards balance is sufficient, you will receive a `Credit-Notice` message and your rewards balance will be cleared. If your rewards balance is less than 0.001 ALT, you will receive an `Error` message. It is recommended that you continue to bet and withdraw all your rewards at once after the balance accumulates to more than 0.01 ALT.
