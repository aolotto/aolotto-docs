# üîç Deposit

To participate in Aolotto betting, payments are made using $wUSDC. This is a stablecoin wrapped by Ethereum's USDC, transferred via AOX. With AOX, you can easily deposit or withdraw funds from your Ethereum wallet  or exchange wallet. $wUSDC allows you to make payments and transfers within the AO ecosystem without gas fees, making it ideal for small transactions.
