# ðŸª™ Altoken

Altoken ($ALT) is the profit-sharing token of the **Aolotto** ecosystem, with a maximum supply of 210,000,000. Holding $ALT allows you to share all the profits of the Aolotto ecosystem. In the future, different pools will be gradually launched. All the profits **contributed** by all the pools will be distributed to $ALT holders according to their proportion of holdings.

Holding $ALT also allows participation in the decentralized governance of **Aolotto**, with no limits on proposing, voting, and launching pools for new tokens.

### Distribution <a href="#fa-xing-xi-jie" id="fa-xing-xi-jie"></a>

$ALT is 100% launched fairly to the community. The initial **30%** (63,000,000) is held by the AolottoFoundation and the faucet address respectively. Early birds can get tokens for free via the faucet to bet and earn more tokens via Betting-As-Mining, or you can participate in official events to get contributor rewards. The remaining **70%** (147,000,000) is issued linearly through **betting as mining**. &#x20;

PS: The AolottoFundation holding address, the faucet address, and the $ALT token process cannot participate in betting.

### Betting as Mining <a href="#tou-zhu-ji-wa-kuang" id="tou-zhu-ji-wa-kuang"></a>

70% of the total $ALT and 147,000,000 tokens are issued linearly based on the $ALT prize pool. After each lottery round, the Altoken process will be triggered to mint 0.01% of the remaining supply. The newly minted tokens will be transferred to the pool process. They will be distributed to the user's reward balance according to the proportion of the user's cumulative bets in the pool. Users manually claim them to their process or wallet.

### Contributor's Fund <a href="#gong-xian-zhe-ji-li" id="gong-xian-zhe-ji-li"></a>

&#x20;42,000,000 $ALT (20% of the total) held by AolottoFoundation, which will be used to incentivize contributors and early investors in the community, including but not limited to development, operation, and promotion. The details of AolottoFoundation's expenditure will be disclosed in the Discord community.

### Profit Sharing <a href="#li-run-fen-xiang" id="li-run-fen-xiang"></a>

**Aolotto** will gradually open pools for different tokens. pools will uniformly collect a fixed amount of income tax (10%, the community can vote to adjust the tax ratio) from the winning users, and the tax revenue will be distributed fairly to $ALT holders in proportion.

1. Calculation formula: Share amount = Accumulated tax benefits \* ($ALT holdings / $ALT circulation)
2. Profits are distributed in real-time. After the betting round ends, profits are settled in real-time and sent to all $ALT holder addresses;
3. All $ALT taxes generated by the $ALT staking process belong to the AolottoFoundation and will not be shared with the community as profits;
