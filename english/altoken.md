# ðŸª™ Altoken

Altoken ($ALT) is the profit-sharing token of the **Aolotto** ecosystem, with a maximum supply of 210,000,000. Holding $ALT allows you to share in all the profits of the Aolotto ecosystem. In the future, different pools will be gradually launched. All the profits **contributed** by all the pools will be distributed to $ALT holders according to their proportion of holdings.

Holding $ALT also allows participation in the decentralized governance of **Aolotto**, with no limits on proposing, voting, and launching pools for new tokens.

### Profit Sharing <a href="#li-run-fen-xiang" id="li-run-fen-xiang"></a>

**Aolotto** will gradually open betting agreements for different types of tokens. The betting agreement will uniformly collect a fixed amount of income tax (10%, the community can vote to adjust the tax ratio) from the winning users, and the tax revenue will be distributed fairly to $ALT holders in proportion.

1. Calculation formula: Share amount = Accumulated tax benefits \* ($ALT holdings / $ALT circulation)
2. Profits are distributed in real-time. After the betting round ends, profits are settled in real-time and sent to all $ALT holder addresses;
3. All $ALT taxes generated by the $ALT staking process belong to the AolottoFoundation and will not be shared with the community as profits;
