# ðŸª™ Altoken

Altoken ($ALT) is the profit-sharing token of the **Aolotto** ecosystem, with a maximum supply of 210,000,000. Holding $ALT allows you to share all the profits of the Aolotto ecosystem. In the future, different pools will be gradually launched. All the profits **contributed** by all the pools will be distributed to $ALT holders according to their proportion of holdings.

Holding $ALT also allows participation in the decentralized governance of **Aolotto**, with no limits on proposing, voting, and launching pools for new tokens.

### Distribution <a href="#fa-xing-xi-jie" id="fa-xing-xi-jie"></a>

$ALT is 100% launched fairly to the community. The initial **30%** (63,000,000) is held by the AolottoFoundation and the faucet address respectively. Early birds can get tokens for free via the faucet to bet and earn more tokens via Betting-As-Mining, or you can participate in official events to get contributor rewards. The remaining **70%** (147,000,000) is issued linearly through **betting as mining**. &#x20;

PS: The AolottoFundation holding address, the faucet address, and the $ALT token process cannot participate in betting.

### Betting as Mining <a href="#tou-zhu-ji-wa-kuang" id="tou-zhu-ji-wa-kuang"></a>

70% of the total supply of $ALT, equaling 147,000,000 tokens, is issued linearly based on the $ALT prize pool. At the end of each lottery round, the Altoken process will be triggered to mint 0.01% of the remaining supply. The newly minted tokens are transferred to the pool process and distributed to all users according to their percentage of cumulative bets in the pool. Users can manually claim these tokens to their process or wallet.

### Contributor's Fund <a href="#gong-xian-zhe-ji-li" id="gong-xian-zhe-ji-li"></a>

42,000,000 $ALT (20% of the total supply) is held by the AolottoFoundation, which will use it to incentivize community contributors and early investors, including but not limited to development, operations, and promotion. Details of the AolottoFoundation's expenditures will be disclosed in the Discord community.

### Profit Sharing <a href="#li-run-fen-xiang" id="li-run-fen-xiang"></a>

**Aolotto** will gradually open pools for different tokens. These pools will uniformly collect a fixed income tax (10%, which the community can vote to adjust) from winning users. The tax revenue will be fairly distributed to $ALT holders proportionally.

1. Share amount = Accumulated tax benefits \* ($ALT holdings / $ALT circulation)
2. Profits are distributed in real-time. After each betting round ends, profits are settled immediately and sent to all $ALT holders' addresses.
3. All $ALT taxes generated from the $ALT pool process belong to the AolottoFoundation and will not be shared with the community as profits.
