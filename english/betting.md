# 🎲 Betting

Currently, betting is only supported through the AOS command line. The web application will be launched soon. The minimum bet amount is 0.001 ALT, and bets must be placed on a 3-digit number between 000-999. There is no limit on the number of bets you can place. Betting is extremely simple. To participate in the latest round, simply transfer $ALT to the **AOLOTTO\*ALT** process at `wqwklmuSqSPGaeMR7dHuciyvBDtt1UjmziAoWu-pKuI`.

### Quick Pick

```lua
--[[
	In AOS, set the Aolotto Pool and altoken process IDs to global variables POOL and ALT 
	respectively for subsequent calls.
]]--
POOL = "wqwklmuSqSPGaeMR7dHuciyvBDtt1UjmziAoWu-pKuI" 
ALT = "dzkRvtoLH6mtIW893eJSO4vdJBc-JT8N1fnBmcDVWdY" 

--[[
	在AOS中发起转账，Recipient填写为设置好的全局变量POOL;
	请将Quantity设置为你希望投注的金额,ALT精度为3位，1意味着实际的投注金额为0.001ALT；
	如果你希望投注1ALT，请将Quantity设置为'1000';
]]--
Send({ 
	Target = ALT, 
	Action = "Transfer", 
	Recipient = POOL, 
	Quantity = "1" 
})
```

Make a $ALT transfer to POOL, If the account balance is sufficient, you will successfully participate in the latest betting round. The system will automatically pick numbers for you at random. After the bet is successful, you will receive a message with the Action `Lotto-Notice`. Enter `Inbox[#Inbox].Data` to print the text of the Lotto-Notice, which contains the number information picked by the random algorithm. If the $ALT balance of your process or wallet address is insufficient, you will receive a `Transfer-Error` message and the bet will fail.

### Manual Pick

```lua
Send({ 
	Target = ALT, 
	Action = "Transfer", 
	Recipient = POOL, 
	Quantity = "2",
	["X-Numbers"] = "007" -- 000-999之间的任意3位数字
})
-- 下注结果：007*2
```

If you wish to choose your own numbers when placing bets, simply add an `X-Numbers` tag when sending a transfer. The numbers must follow the 3-digit standard. Illegal numbers will be automatically filtered out and random numbers generated by an algorithm will be used instead.

### Pick Multiple&#x20;

```lua
Send({ 
	Target = ALT, 
	Action = "Transfer", 
	Recipient = POOL, 
	Quantity = "3",
	["X-Numbers"] = "000,001,005" -- 号码之间使用","间隔
})
-- 下注结果：000*1，001*1, 005*1
```

You can input multiple numbers at once for batch betting. The bet quantity must be greater than or equal to the number of entered numbers. If you enter more numbers than bets, the excess numbers will be automatically discarded. If there are more bets than entered numbers, the system will repeat the numbers in order to fill all bets. Ensure that the total bet quantity matches the transferred quantity.

### Pick Sequence

```lua
Send({ 
	Target = ALT, 
	Action = "Transfer", 
	Recipient = POOL, 
	Quantity = "10",
	["X-Numbers"] = "000-009" -- 使用“-”代表取值区间；
})
-- 下注结果：000*1，001*1, 002*1, 003*1, 004*1, 005*1, 006*1, 007*1, 008*1, 009*1   
```

Generate a batch of bets with sequential values. If the range of values exceeds the Quantity, the excess values will be automatically discarded. For example, if Quantity=2 and the range of values is '000-010', the final bet results generated are 000\*_1, 001\*_1.

### Add a donee

```lua
Send({ 
	Target = ALT, 
	Action = "Transfer", 
	Recipient = POOL, 
	Quantity = "3",
	["X-Numbers"] = "000,001,002",
	["X-Donee"] = "j0Lrrv1ltimsYnD_5f-8Fp3QKcAbUjckn7kjCZCfvhk" -- 添加受益人tag和地址，地址务必为aos process地址，AR钱包地址无法发起提取奖金的请求；
})
-- 以上投注中奖后，奖金将会分配给受益人，但投注量将会叠加到购买人信息中。
```

Generally, the purchase address is the beneficiary, and the winnings are distributed to the purchase address by default. However, you can add another address as a beneficiary using the `X-Donee` tag. You can set the address of your friends or family as a lottery gift.
