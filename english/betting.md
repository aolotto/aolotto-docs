# ðŸŽ² Betting

Currently, betting is only supported through the AOS command line. The web application will be launched soon. The minimum bet amount is 0.001 ALT, and bets must be placed on a 3-digit number between 000-999. There is no limit on the number of bets you can place. Betting is extremely simple. To participate in the latest betting round, simply transfer $ALT to the **AOLOTTO\*ALT** process at `wqwklmuSqSPGaeMR7dHuciyvBDtt1UjmziAoWu-pKuI`.
