# üëè Welcome

**Aolotto** is the first decentralized lottery protocol built on [Arweave AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/), which is Simple, Transparent, and Open. Each round lasts 24 hours and ends with a draw by algorithms. The block hash after the round ends, the number of bets, and other factors are used as the seed for the algorithm to generate a 3-digit lucky number between 000-999. The bets that match perfectly will share 50% of the total prize pool, The remaining 50% will be used for the next round as the basic rewards.

Currently, we've only launched a pool for $ALT([altoken](altoken.md)), which is the profit-sharing token of the **Aolotto** ecosystem. The **AOLOTTO\*ALT** pool only supports using $ALT to buy or bet.  All the $ALT will be 100% fairly launched to the community. Early birds can get for free via [the faucet](faucet.md) . In the future, **Aolotto** will gradually launch other pools for the AO standard tokens. The **AOLOTTO\*AO** pool based on the AO native token will be launched after February 2025 when $AO is circulated.

Compared to centralized lottery agencies, **Aolotto** has a 100% payout rate, and the fairness and transparency of both betting and drawing are completely ensured by the algorithm, which cannot be black-boxed. **Aolotto** stands for **AO** (short for Arweave AO) + **lotto**. [AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/) is a decentralized parallel computer built on the [Arweave](https://arweave.org/) permanent network. Before using **Aolotto**, you need to understand and master the basic AOS knowledge and skills. The AO [cookbook](https://cookbook\_ao.arweave.dev/) can help you get started.

### Guides

The **AOLOTTO\*ALT** pool currently only supports interaction on AOS. The Web Application will be released soon. Interacting with AOS is not complicated. You can master the essential commands in 10 minutes by following the guidelines below.
