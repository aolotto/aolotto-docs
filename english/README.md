# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

A**olotto** is the first decentralized lottery protocol running on [Arweave AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/), which is simple, transparent, and open. A round ends every 24 hours and uses an algorithm to draw. The block hash after the round ends, the amount of bets, and other factors are used as the seed for the algorithm to generate a 3-digit lucky number between 000-999. The bets that match perfectly will share 50% of the total prize pool, and the remaining 50% will be transferred to the next round as the basic bonus.

Currently, we've only launched a betting process (a lottery pool based on a smart contract) for $ALT([altoken](altoken.md)), which is the profit-sharing token of the **Aolotto** ecosystem. The **AOLOTTO\*ALT** process only supports using $ALT to buy or bet.  All the $ALT will be 100% fairly launched to the community. Early birds can get $ALT for free via [the faucet](faucet.md) . In the future, **Aolotto** will gradually launch the betting processes for other AO standard tokens. The process based on the AO native token (**AOLOTTO\*AO**) will be launched after $AO is circulated in February 2025.

Compared to centralized lottery agencies, **Aolotto** has a 100% payout, and the fairness and transparency of both betting and lottery drawing are completely ensured by the algorithm, which cannot be black boxed. **Aolotto** stands for **AO** (short for Arweave AO) + **lotto**. AO is a decentralized parallel computer built on the Arweave permanent network. Before using **Aolotto**, you need to understand and master the necessary AOS knowledge and skills. The AO [cookbook](https://cookbook\_ao.arweave.dev/) can help you get started.

### Guides

The **AOLOTTO\*ALT** betting process currently only supports interaction through AOS. The Web Application will be released soon. Interacting through AOS is not complicated. You can master the essential commands in 10 minutes by following the guidelines below.
