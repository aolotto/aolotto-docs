# üëè Welcome

Aolotto is the first decentralized lottery protocol on [**AO**](https://ao.arweave.dev/). It pioneers the $1 on-chain lottery. Users can participate anonymously and without permission, with the entire betting and drawing process governed by the protocol's fair and transparent algorithms. Aolotto is not affiliated with any private entity or institution, and operates entirely through community governance and decentralization.

**Fairness and Transparency** are the core principles behind Aolotto‚Äôs design. The code is 100% open-source. Click [here](https://github.com/aolotto/protocols) to view the source code, and click [here](https://www.ao.link/#/entity/3IYRZBvph5Xx9566RuGWdLvUHnOcG8cHXT95s1CYRBo) to verify the protocol‚Äôs CA: `3IYRZBvph5Xx9566RuGWdLvUHnOcG8cHXT95s1CYRBo`.

With Aolotto, you can **Bet to Win** (place bets for a chance at the grand prize) and **Bet to Mint** (bet to mine tokens). The total supply of $ALT (Ao Lotto Token) is 210 million, with no tokens reserved for the team. 100% of the tokens are distributed to the community through the **Bet2Mint** mechanism. Additionally, 40% of the protocol‚Äôs revenue will be used for dividends and buybacks, benefiting $ALT holders. The ALT/USDC liquidity pool will launch on Permaswap, where users can either hold $ALT for long-term rewards or sell it for short-term profits.

Aolotto is more than just a lottery game‚Äîit‚Äôs the heart of **LottoFi**. We invite developers and creators to join us in building a community-driven ecosystem centered around $ALT. LottoFi envisions a borderless gaming and content environment, akin to a decentralized PowerBall. Just as PlayTech dominates global gambling technology, LottoFi aims to leverage decentralized technologies to redefine the gaming and content space. [**Join LottoFi**](https://docs.aolotto.com/cn/lottofi) today!
