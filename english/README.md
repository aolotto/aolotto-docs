# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

**aolotto** is the first decentralized lottery protocol running on [Arweave AO](https://ao.arweave.dev/), which is simple, transparent, and open. A round ends every 24 hours and uses an algorithm to draw. The block hash after the round ends, the amount of bets, and other factors are used as the seed for the algorithm to generate a 3-digit lucky number between 000-999. The bets that match perfectly will share 50% of the total prize pool, and the remaining 50% will be transferred to the next round as the basic bonus.

Currently, the betting process **\*ALT** based on the **aolotto** profit-sharing token $ALT ([**altoken**](altoken.md)) is open, only $ALT can be used for betting now. $ALT is 100% fairly launched to the community. You can get $ALT for free via [the faucet](faucet.md) . In the future, **aolotto** will gradually open the betting process for other AO standard tokens. The betting process based on the AO native token (**aolotto\*AO**) will be open after $AO is circulated in February next year.

Compared to centralized lottery agencies, **aolotto** has a 100% payout, and the fairness and transparency of both betting and lottery drawing are completely ensured by the algorithm, which cannot be black boxed. **aolotto** stands for **ao** (short for Arweave AO) + **lotto**. AO is a decentralized parallel computer built on the Arweave permanent network. Before using **aolotto**, you need to understand and master the necessary AOS knowledge and skills. The AO [cookbook](https://cookbook\_ao.arweave.dev/) can help you get started.
