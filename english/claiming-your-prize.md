To claim your prize, simply click on your user avatar to go to your profile page. In the top right corner, youâ€™ll find the **Claim Prize** button. Once your prize account balance is greater than 0, the claim button will become active. After clicking it and confirming, your prize ($wUSDC) will be transferred to your personal wallet, minus any applicable taxes.

## **Grand Prize Tax**

Winners are required to pay a grand prize tax. The protocol collects a flat 40% of the total prize amount, which is distributed to $ALT holders to support the development of the community. Compared to traditional lotteries, which often have a 50% payout rate along with additional income taxes (which vary by region), Aolotto ensures that 60% of the accumulated prize pool goes directly to the winner.
